1. Project **CSharpWebAPIApplication** is the Empty project with only Web API. It does not contains views folder or other html page such as home page. I think it suitable as the background for a app: only provide the interface to return data.

2. Project **CSharpWebAPIApplication472** is same as the project *CSharpWebAPIApplication*, but it is based on ASP.Net framework 4.7.2 and created by VS 2019.

3. Project **CSharpMVCWebAPIApplication** is the Web API project(defaut contains MVC and Web API). It comes with the home page Views->Home->Index.cshtml and the mapping for the cshtml file in the Views folder. I think it suitable as as the background for a website. And it contains jQuery and other package for website. In addition I choose the option Add unit tests, so there is another project CSharpMVCWebAPIApplication.Tests in the solution, we can run the unit tests in "Test->run->All tests".

4. Project **CSharpWebFormsApplication** is the Web Forms project(defualt contains Web Forms), I know less about it. I will update this part in the future.
